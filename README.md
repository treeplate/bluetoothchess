# bluetoothchess

A version of chess where you get coins for knight-related captures, and can spend coins to make knights appear.
In theory there's supposed to be bluetooth-based multiplayer, but I couldn't get that to work.
If you take a knight, you get 3 horsecoins.
If you take something with a knight, you get the value of that piece.
Values of pieces:
Pawn: 1 horsecoin
Bishop: 2 horsecoins
Knight: 3 horsecoins
Rook: 4 horsecoins
Queen: 7 horsecoins
King: 10 horsecoins
There's also an implementation of TicTacToe.
